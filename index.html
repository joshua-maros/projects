                    </div>
                    <div class="body"> I wrote this project to get experience with the Vulkan API as well as with
                        raytracing in general. It requires no specialized hardware, and can run on any device with a
                        Vulkan-compatible GPU. It even runs on my laptop which only has Intel integrated graphics,
                        although with a noticably slow framerate. It functions by tracing one sample per pixel and then
                        denoising the resulting data using several bilateral blurs. Blue noise is also used to generate
                        random sampling values to help reduce the number of artifacts present in the denoised image.
                        Whenever possible, samples from the previous frame are carried over to the next frame. Chunks of
                        the world are loaded dynamically so that no GPU memory is wasted storing chunks that are empty
                        or are not visible to the user. </div>

                    <div class="body"> Modular synthesis is based on the idea of giving artists a box of audio
                        processing components and letting the artist hook them up any way they want. I wanted to look
                        into digital versions of this, but was frustrated by how many available options were either too
                        limited or too tedious to use. I decided to make my own. Modules are displayed on the right-hand
                        side of the screen. Modules can be connected to each other by dragging wires between two
                        sockets. The left hand side shows controls for the currently selected module. Each knob can
                        either be manually set to a fixed value, or controlled by another module (or multiple modules)
                        through a wire. </div>

                    <div class="body"> I find game development to be a fun way to gain programming experience. The three
                        games in this video were created for 'game jams' - events where individuals and teams compete to
                        create games based on a particular theme within a short amount of time. The first game in the
                        video is "Yarn Arsonist", created under the theme "One Shot". The idea is you only get one match
                        to burn down the whole building. The challenge is to string things together as much as possible
                        before using up your single match. The second game shown is "Shadow Ops", created under the
                        theme "Shadow Puppets". It has a variety of mechanics, the main one being that you can pop out
                        of and into the bodies of any guard. Different guards have different items that can be used to
                        reach the end of the level. The third game shown has a very long name, and was created under the
                        theme "Sticky Justice". Many different games have slimes as enemies, but I wanted to make the
                        game more interesting than your average slime genocide simulator. Instead, the slimes serve a
                        dual purpose as a puzzle mechanic, as you are able to stick to whatever walls you hit them
                        against. <div class="click-hint"><span>Click for more info.</span></div>

                    <div class="body"> I created this project for a past class of mine. One of the
                        components of the class was a social justice simulation. Every student became citizens in a
                        simulated society. They performed jobs, payed rent, owned property (desks), and made laws. My
                        job was to be the banker and keep track of everyone's finances. This mostly meant keeping track
                        of rent, salaries, and payments. In addition, there were often randomized events that impacted
                        everyone's finances, such as "major economic crisis" or "reversal of fortune". Normally, all of
                        these tasks were done semi-manually with an Excel spreadsheet. I decided to use my programming
                        knowledge to build a webapp to automate most all of the tasks I needed to do. I also released
                        the app to other class periods who were doing their own simulations, and took bug reports and
                        feature requests from the bankers in those periods. </div>

                    <div class="summary"> A work-in-progress language and compiler designed to allow for optimization
                        during runtime. </div>
                    <div class="body"> This project got started while I was working on the synthesizer mentioned above.
                        I noticed that there were many parameters that, if set to a constant value, would allow a large
                        portion of their corresponding computation to be done only once. However, it is also possible
                        for the user to connect wires such that these parameters changes constantly. Because of this,
                        all parameters have to be programmed to allow for this case, which is sometimes much more
                        expensive. The idea behind this project is to make a compiler that is embedded into a larger
                        application. The larger application can then compile Waveguide source files on the fly, applying
                        optimizations based on known inputs. This optimized code can then be run as a regular function
                        inside the larger application. </div>
